    "featuredStory": "<p> A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry.</p><p>&quot;My boy,&quot; said his mother, &quot;be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time.&quot;</p> <p><em>Do not attempt too much at once.</em></p>"
